# Browser Based Blockchain With WebRTC communication

This is a project to create a blockchain that exists only within a browser client using WebRTC for browser client to client peer connections. At the moment for the purpose of decentralization connection has to be performed manually using the WebRTC protocol, as otherwise there is a need for a signaling server to find peers. Though I do plan on adding signalling server support using PeerJS or something similar should users choose to do so. 

As the blockchain size grows and exceeds what the browser can handle it will inevitably slow down to the point of becoming unusable. 

Some of the goals for this project include learning about blockchains, merkle trees, WebRTC, peer-to-peer browser connections and networking, Vue 3 and Pinia, and effectively structuring a large scale software development project, as well as, eventually, optimizing it for memory to try and keep it usable as long as possible.
